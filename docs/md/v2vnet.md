                                         1     Introduction
                                         While a world densely populated with self-driving vehicles (SDVs) might seem
                                         futuristic, these vehicles will one day soon be the norm. They will provide safer,
                                         cheaper and less congested transportation solutions for everyone, everywhere. A
                                         core component of self-driving vehicles is their ability to perceive the world. From
                                         sensor data, the SDV needs to reason about the scene in 3D, identify the other
                                         agents, and forecast how their futures might play out. These tasks are commonly
                                         referred to as perception and motion forecasting. Both strong perception and
                                         motion forecasting are critical for the SDV to plan and maneuver through traffic
                                         to get from one point to another safely.
                                             The reliability of perception and motion forecasting algorithms has signifi-
                                         cantly improved in the past few years due to the development of neural network
                                         architectures that can reason in 3D and intelligently fuse multi-sensor data (e.g.,
                                         images, LiDAR, maps) [28, 29]. Motion forecasting algorithm performance has
                                         been further improved by building good multimodal distributions [4,6,12,19] that
                                         capture diverse actor behaviour and by modelling actor interactions [3,25,36,37].
                                         Recently, [5, 31] propose approaches that perform joint perception and mo-
                                         tion forecasting, dubbed perception and prediction (P&P), further increasing
                                         the accuracy while being computationally more efficient than classical two-step
                                         pipelines.

Fig. 1: Left: Safety critical scenario of a pedestrian coming out of
occlusion. V2V communication can be leveraged to use the fact that
multiple self-driving vehicles see the scene from different viewpoints,
and thus see through occluders. Right: Example V2VSim Scene. Virtual
scene with occluded actor (blue) and SDVs (red and green), Rendered
LiDAR from each SDV in the scene.

    Despite these advances, challenges remain. For example, objects that are

heavily occluded or far away result in sparse observations and pose a
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Failing to detect and
predict the intention of these hard-to-see actors might have
catastrophic consequences in safety critical situations when there are
only a few miliseconds to react: imagine the SDV driving along a road
and a child chasing after a soccer ball runs into the street from behind
a parked car (Fig. 1, left). This situation is difficult for both SDVs
and human drivers to correctly perceive and adjust for. The crux of the
problem is that the SDV and the human can only see the scene from a
single viewpoint. However, SDVs could have super-human capabilities if
we equip them with the ability to transmit information and utilize the
information received from nearby vehicles to better perceive the world.
Then the SDV could see behind the occlusion and detect the child
earlier, allowing for a safer avoidance maneuver. In this paper, we
consider the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication set- ting, where
each vehicle can broadcast and receive information to/from nearby
vehicles (within a 70m radius). Note that this broadcast range is
realistic based on existing communication protocols \[21\]. We show that
to achieve the best com- promise of having strong perception and motion
forecasting performance while also satisfying existing hardware
transmission bandwidth capabilities, we should send compressed
intermediate representations of the P&P neural network. Thus, we derive
a novel P&P model, called V2VNet, which utilizes a spatially aware graph
neural network (GNN) to aggregate the information received from all the
nearby SDVs, allowing us to intelligently combine information from
different points in time and viewpoints in the scene. To evaluate our
approach, we require a dataset where multiple self-driving vehicles are
in the same local traffic scene. Unfortunately, no such dataset exists.
Therefore, our second contribution is a new dataset, dubbed V2V-Sim (see
Fig. 1, right) that mimics the setting where there are multiple SDVs
driving in the area. Towards this goal, we use a high-fidelity LiDAR
simulator \[33\], which uses a large catalog of static 3D scenes and
dynamic objects built from real-world data, to simulate realistic LiDAR
point clouds for a given traffic scene. With this simu- lator, we can
recreate traffic scenarios recorded from the real-world and simulate
them as if a percentage of the vehicles are SDVs in the network. We show
that V2VNet and other V2V methods significantly boosts performance

representations reduce bandwidth requirements without sacrificing
performance. We hope this work brings attention to the potential
benefits of the V2V setting for bringing safer autonomous vehicles on
the road. To enable this, we plan to release this new dataset and make a
challenge with a leaderboard and evaluation server.

contrast, we leverage the power of deep networks by transmitting a
compressed intermedi- ate representation. Furthermore, while previous
works demonstrate results on a limited number of simple and unrealistic
scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our model on a diverse
large-scale self-driving V2V dataset.

for downstream inference. A straightforward approach is to perform
permutation invariant operations such as pooling \[10,40\] over features
from different vehicles. However, this strategy ignores cross-vehicle
relations (spatial locations, headings, times) and fails to jointly
reason about features from the sender and receiver. On the other hand,

processing graph-structured data \[15, 18, 26, 46\]. MPNN \[17\]

uses GNNs to estimate value functions of map nodes and share vehicle
information for coordinated route planning. We believe GNNs are tailored
for V2V communication, as each vehicle can be a node in the graph.
V2VNet leverages GNNs to aggregate and combine messages from other
vehicles.

Active Perception: In V2V perception, the receiving vehicle should
aggregate information from different viewpoints such that its field of
view is maximized, trusting more the view that can see better. Our work
is related to a long line of work in active perception, which focuses on
deciding what action the agent should take to better perceive the
environment. Active perception has been ef- fective in localization and
mapping \[13, 22\], vision-based navigation \[14\], serving as a
learning signal \[20, 48\], and various other robotics applications
\[9\]. In this work, rather than actively steering SDVs to obtain better
viewpoint and sending information to the others, we consider a more
realistic scenario where multiple SDVs have their own routes but are
currently in the same geographical area, allowing the SDVs to see better
by sharing perception messages.

3 Perceiving the World by Leveraging Multiple Vehicles In this paper, we
design a novel perception and motion forecasting model that enables the
self-driving vehicle to leverage the fact that several SDVs may be

present in the same geographic area. Following the success of joint
perception and prediction algorithms \[3, 5, 30, 31\], which we call
P&P, we design our approach as a joint architecture to perform both
tasks, which is enhanced to incorporate information received from other
vehicles. Specifically, we would like to devise our P&P model to do the
following: given sensor data the SDV should (1) process this data, (2)
broadcast it, (3) incorporate information received from other nearby
SDVs, and then (4) generate final estimates of where all traffic
participants are in the 3D space and their predicted future
trajectories. Two key questions arise in the V2V setting: (i) what
information should each vehicle broadcast to retain all the important
information while minimizing the transmission bandwidth required? (ii)
how should each vehicle incorporate the information received from other
vehicles to increase the accuracy of its perception and motion
forecasting outputs? In this section we address these two questions.

3.1 Which Information should be Transmitted

An SDV can choose to broadcast three types of information: (i) the raw
sensor data, (ii) the intermediate representations of its P&P system, or
(iii) the output detections and motion forecast trajectories. While all
three message types are valuable for improving performance, we would
like to minimize the message sizes while maximizing P&P accuracy gains.
Note that small message sizes are critical because we want to leverage
cheap, low-bandwidth, decentralized communica- tion devices. While
sending raw measurements minimizes information loss, they require more
bandwidth. Furthermore, the receiving vehicle would need to pro- cess
all additional sensor data received, which might prevent it from meeting
the real-time inference requirements. On the other hand, transmitting
the outputs of the P&P system is very good in terms of bandwidth, as
only a few numbers need to be broadcasted. However, we may lose valuable
scene context and uncertainty information that could be very important
to better fuse the information. In this paper, we argue that sending
intermediate representations of the P&P network achieves the best of
both worlds. First, each vehicle processes its own sensor data and
computes its intermediate feature representation. This is com- pressed
and broadcasted to nearby SDVs. Then, each SDV’s intermediate repre-
sentation is updated using the received messages from other SDVs. This
is further processed through additional network layers to produce the
final perception and motion forecasting outputs. This approach has two
advantages: (1) Intermediate representations in deep networks can be
easily compressed \[11, 43\], while retain- ing important information
for downstream tasks. (2) It has low computation overhead, as the sensor
data from other vehicles has already been pre-processed. In the
following, we first showcase how to compute the intermediate repre-
sentations and how to compress them. We then show how each vehicle
should incorporate the received information to increase the accuracy of
its P&P outputs. 6 T.H. Wang et al.

3.2 Leveraging Multiple Vehicles

V2VNet has three main stages: (1) a convolutional network block that
pro- cesses raw sensor data and creates a compressible intermediate
representation, (2) a cross-vehicle aggregation stage, which aggregates
information received from multiple vehicles with the vehicle’s internal
state (computed from its own sen- sor data) to compute an updated
intermediate representation, (3) an output network that computes the
final P&P outputs. We now describe these steps in more details. We refer
the reader to Fig. 2 for our V2VNet architecture.

LiDAR Convolution Block: Following the architecture from \[45\], we ex-
tract features from LiDAR data and transform them into bird’s-eye-view
(BEV). Specifically, we voxelize the past five LiDAR point cloud sweeps
into 15.6cm3 voxels, apply several convolutional layers, and output
feature maps of shape H × W × C, where H × W denotes the scene range in
BEV, and C is the number of feature channels. We use 3 layers of 3x3
convolution filters (with strides of 2, 1, 2) to produce a 4x
downsampled spatial feature map. This is the intermediate representation
that we then compress and broadcast to other nearby SDVs.

Compression: We now describe how each vehicle compresses its
intermediate representations prior to transmission. We adapt Ballé et
al.’s variational im- age compression algorithm \[2\] to compress our
intermediate representations; a convolutional network learns to compress
our representations with the help of a learned hyperprior. The latent
representation is then quantized and encoded losslessly with very few
bits via entropy encoding. Note that our compression module is
differentiable and therefore trainable, allowing our approach to learn
how to preserve the feature map information while minimizing bandwidth.

Cross-vehicle Aggregation: After the SDV computes its intermediate
repre- sentation and transmits its compressed bitstream, it decodes the
representation received from other vehicles. Specifically, we apply
entropy decoding to the bit stream and apply a decoder CNN to extract
the decompressed feature map. We  V2VNet: V2V Communication for Joint

then aggregate the received information from other vehicles to produce
an up- dated intermediate representation. Our aggregation module has to
handle the fact that different SDVs are located at different spatial
locations and see the actors at different timestamps due to the rolling
shutter of the LiDAR sensor and the different triggering per vehicle of
the sensors. This is important as the intermediate feature
representations are spatially aware. Towards this goal, each vehicle
uses a fully-connected graph neural network (GNN) \[39\] as the
aggregation module, where each node in the GNN is the state
representation of an SDV in the scene, including itself (see Fig. 3).
Each SDV maintains its own local graph based on which SDVs are within
range (i.e., 70 m). GNNs are a natural choice as they handle dynamic
graph topologies, which arise in the V2V setting. GNNs are deep-learning
models tailored to graph- structured data: each node maintains a state
representation, and for a fix number of iterations, messages are sent
between nodes and the node states are updated based on the aggregated
received information using a neural network. Note that the GNN messages
are different from the messages transmitted/received by the SDVs: the
GNN computation is done locally by the SDV. We design our GNN to
temporally warp and spatially transform the received messages to the
receiver’s coordinate system. We now describe the aggregation process
that the receiving vehicle performs. We refer the reader to Alg. 1 for
pseudocode. We first compensate for the time delay between the vehicles
to create an initial state for each node in the graph. Specifically, for
each node, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as
input the received inter- mediate representation ẑi , the relative 6DoF
pose ∆pi between the receiving and transmitting SDVs and the time delay
∆ti→k with respect to the receiv- ing vehicle sensor time. Note that for
the node representing the receiving car, ẑ is directly its intermediate
representation. The time delay is computed as the time difference
between the sweep start times of each vehicle, based on universal GPS
time. We then take the time-delay-compensated representation and con-
catenate with zeros to augment the capacity of the node state to
aggregate the information received from other vehicles after propagation
(line 3 in Alg. 1). Next we perform GNN message passing. The key insight
is that because the other SDVs are in the same local area, the node
representations will have overlapping fields of view. If we
intelligently transform the representations and share information
between nodes where the fields-of-view overlap, we can en- 8 T.H. Wang

hance the SDV’s understanding of the scene and produce better output
P&P. Fig. 3 visually depicts our spatial aggregation module. We first
apply a relative spatial transformation ξi→k to warp the intermediate
state of the i-th node to send a GNN message to the k-th node. We then
perform joint reasoning on the spatially-aligned feature maps of both
nodes using a CNN. The final modified message is computed as in Alg. 1
line 7, where T applies the spatial transfor- mation and resampling of
the feature state via bilinear-interpolation, and Mi→k masks out
non-overlapping areas between the fields of view. Note that with this
design, our messages maintain the spatial awareness. We next aggregate
at each node the received messages via a mask-aware
permutation-invariant function φM and update the node state with a
convolu- tional gated recurrent unit (ConvGRU) (Alg. 1 line 8), where j
∈ N (i) are the neighboring nodes in the network for node i and φM is
the mean operator. The mask-aware accumulation operator ensures only
overlapping fields-of-view are considered. In addition, the gating
mechanism in the node update enables in- formation selection for the
accumulated received messages based on the current belief of the
receiving SDV. After the final iteration, a multilayer perceptron
outputs the updated intermediate representation (Alg. 1 Line 11). We
repeat this message propagation scheme for a fix number of iterations.
Output Network: After performing message passing, we apply a set of four
Inception-like \[42\] convolutional blocks to capture multi-scale
context efficiently, which is important for prediction. Finally, we take
the feature map and exploit two network branches to output detection and
motion forecasting estimates re- spectively. The detection output is (x,
y, w, h, θ), denoting the position, size and orientation of each object.
The output of the motion forecast branch is parame- terized as (xt , yt
), which denotes the object’s location at future time step t. We
forecast the motion of the actors for the next 3 seconds at 0.5 s
intervals. Please see supplementary for additional architecture and
implementation details.

sification output and smooth \`1 on the bounding box parameters. We
apply hard-negative mining to improve performance. We then finetune
jointly the Li- DAR backbone, cross-vehicle aggregation, and output
header modules on our novel V2V dataset (see Sec. 4) with synchronized
inputs (no time delay) using the same loss function. We do not use the
temporal warping function at this stage. During training, for every
example in the mini-batch, we randomly sam- ple the number of connected
vehicles uniformly on \[0, min(c, 6)\], where c is the number of
candidate vehicles available. This is to make sure V2VNet can han- dle
arbitrary graph connectivity while also making sure the fraction of
vehicles on the V2V network remains within the GPU memory constraints.
Finally, the temporal warping function is trained to compensate for time
delay with asyn- chronous inputs, where all other parts of the network
are fixed. We uniformly sample time delay between 0.0s and 0.1s (time of
one 10Hz LiDAR sweep). We then train the compression module with the
main network (backbone, aggre- gation, output header) fixed. We use a
rate-distortion objective, which aims to maximize the bit rate in
transmission while minimizing the distortion between uncompressed and
decompressed data. We define the rate objective as the en- tropy of the
transmitted code, and the distortion objective as the reconstruction
loss (between the decompressed and uncompressed feature maps).

4 V2V-Sim: a dataset for V2V communication

No realistic dataset for V2V communication exists in the literature.
Some ap- proaches simulate the V2V setting by using different frames
from KITTI \[16\] to emulate multiple vehicles \[8,32,44\]. However,
this is unrealistic since sensor mea- surements are at different
timestamps, so moving objects may be at completely different locations
(e.g., a 1 sec. time difference can cause 20 m change in posi- tion).
Other approaches utilize a platoon strategy for data collection
\[7,23,35,47\], where each vehicle follows behind the previous one
closely. While more realistic than using KITTI, this data collection is
biased: the perspectives of different vehicles are highly correlated
with each other, and the data does not provide the 10 T.H. Wang et al.

richness of different V2V scenarios. For example, we will never see SDVs
coming in the opposite direction, or SDVs turning from other lanes at
intersections. To address these deficiencies, we use a high-fidelity
LiDAR simulator, Li- DARsim \[33\], to generate our large-scale V2V
communication dataset, which we call V2V-Sim. LiDARsim is a simulation
system that uses a large catalog of 3D static scenes and dynamic objects
that are built from real-world data collections to simulate new
scenarios. Given a scenario (i.e., scene, vehicle assets and their
trajectories), LiDARsim applies raycasting followed by a deep neural
network to generate a realistic LIDAR point cloud for each frame in the
scenario. We leverage traffic scenarios captured in the real world ATG4D
dataset \[45\] to generate our simulations. We recreate the snippets in
LiDARsim’s virtual world using the ground-truth 3D tracks provided in
ATG4D. By using the same scenario layouts and agent trajectories
recorded from the real world, we can replicate realistic traffic. In
particular, at each timestep, we place the actor 3D- assets into the
virtual scene according to the real-world labels and generate the
simulated LiDAR point cloud seen from the different candidate vehicles
(see Fig. 1, right). We define the candidate vehicles to be non-parked
vehicles that are within the 70-meter broadcast range of the vehicle
that recorded the real- world snippet. We generate 5500 25s snippets
collected from multiple cities. We subsample the frames in the snippets
to produce our final 46,796/4,404 frames for train/test splits for the
V2V-Sim dataset. V2V-Sim has on average 10 candidate vehicles that could
be in the V2V network per sample, with a maximum of 63 and a variance of
7, demonstrating the traffic diversity. The fraction of vehicles that
are candidates increases linearly w.r.t broadcast range.

our approach compared to other transmission and aggregation strategies
as well as single vehicle P&P.

pletely occluded objects (0 LiDAR points hit the object), making the
task much more challenging and realistic than standard benchmarks. For
object de- tection, we compute Average Precision (AP) and
Precision-Recall (PR) Curve at Intersection-over-Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.7. For motion forecasting, we compute absolute \`2 displacement
error of the object center’s location at future timestamps (3s
prediction horizon with 0.5s interval) on true positive detections. We
set the IoU threshold to 0.5 and recall to 0.9 (we pick the highest
recall if 0.9 cannot be reached) to obtain the true positives. These
values were chosen such that we retrieve most objects, which is critical
for safety in self-driving. Note that most self-driving systems adopt
this high recall as operating point. We also compute Trajectory
Collision Rate (TCR), defined as the collision rate between the
predicted trajectories of detected objects, where collision occurs when
two cars overlap with each other more than a specific IoU (i.e.,
collision threshold τ ). This metric evaluates whether the predictions
are consistent with each other. We exclude the other SDVs during
evaluation, as those can be trivially predicted.

Baselines: We evaluate the single vehicle setting, dubbed No Fusion,
which con- sists of LiDAR backbone network and output headers only,
without V2V com- munication. We also introduce two baselines for V2V
communication: LiDAR Fusion and Output Fusion. LiDAR Fusion warps all
received LiDAR sweeps from other vehicles to the coordinate frame of the
receiver via the relative transforma- tion between vehicles (which is
known, as all SDVs are assume to be localized) and performs direct
aggregation. We use the state-of-the-art LiDAR compression algorithm
Draco \[1\] to compress LiDAR Fusion messages. For Output Fusion, each
vehicle sends post-processed outputs, i.e., bounding boxes with
confidence scores, and predicted future trajectories after non-maximum
suppression (NMS). At the receiver end, all bounding boxes and future
trajectories are first trans- formed to the ego-vehicle coordinate
system and then aggregated across vehicles. NMS is then applied again to
produce the final results.

Experimental Details: For all analysis we set the maximum number of SDVs
per scene to be 7 (except for an ablation study measuring how the number
of SDVs affect V2V performance in Fig. 6). All models are trained with

Comparison to Existing Approaches: As shown in Table. 1, V2V-based
models significantly outperform No Fusion on detection (∼20% at IoU 0.7)
and prediction (∼0.2 m
`2 error reduction at 3 sec.). LiDAR Fusion and V2VNet also show strong reduction (20% at 0.01 collision threshold) in TCR. These results demonstrate that all types of V2V communication provide substantial performance gains. Among all V2V approaches, V2VNet is either on-par with LiDAR Fusion (which has no information loss) or achieves the best performance. V2VNet’s slight performance gain over LiDAR Fusion may come from using the GNN in the cross-vehicle aggregation stage to reason about different vehicles’ feature maps more intelligently than naive aggregation. Output Fusion’s drop in performance for TCR is due to the large number of false positives relative to other V2V methods (see detection PR curve Fig. 4, left, at recall > 0.6). Fig. 4 shows the percentage of objects with an`2
error at 3s smaller than a constant. This metric shows similar trends
consistent with Table. 1.

Compression: Fig. 5 shows the tradeoff between transmission bandwidth
and accuracy for different V2V methods with and without compression.
Draco \[1\] achieves 33x compression for LiDAR Fusion, while our
compressed intermedi- ate representations achieved a 417x compression
rate. Note that compression marginally affects the performance. This
shows that the intermediate P&P rep- resentations are much easier to
compress than LiDAR. Given the message size for one timestamp with a
sensor capture rate of 10Hz, we compute the transmission delay based on
V2V communication protocol \[21\]. At the broadcast range 120 meters,
the data rate is roughly 25 Mbps. This means sending V2VNet messages may
induce roughly 9ms delay, which is very low.

SDV Density: We now investigate how V2V performance changes as a
function of % of SDVs in the scene. To make this setting like the real
world, for a given 25s snippet, we choose a fraction of candidate
vehicles in the scene to be SDVs for the whole snippet. As shown in Fig.
6, V2V performance increases linearly with the % of SDVs in both
detection and prediction.

Number of LiDAR points, Velocity: As shown in Fig. 7 (a) V2V meth- ods
boost the performance on completely- and mostly-occluded objects (0 and

1∼6 LiDAR points) by over 60% in AP. This is an extremely exciting
result, since the main challenges of perception and motion forecasting
are objects with very sparse observations. Fig. 7 (b) shows performance
on objects with different velocities. While other V2V methods drop in
detection performance as object velocity increases, V2VNet has
consistent performance gains over No Fusion on fast moving objects.
Output Fusion and LiDAR Fusion may have deteriorated due to the rolling
shutter of the moving SDV and the motion blur of moving agents during
the temporal sweep of the LiDAR sensor. These effects are more severe in
the V2V setting, where SDVs may be moving in opposite directions at high
speeds while recording moving actors. Although not explicitly tackling
such issue, V2VNet performs contextual and iterative reasoning on
information from different vehicles, which may indirectly handle rolling
shutter inconsistencies.

Imperfect Localization: We simulate inaccurate pose estimates by intro-
ducing different levels of Gaussian (σ = 0.4m) and von Mises (σ = 4◦ ;
κ1 = 4.873 × 10−3 ) noise to position and heading of the transmitting
SDVs. As shown in Fig. 8, on both noise types, V2VNet outperforms LiDAR
Fusion and Output Fusion in P&P performance. The only exception is
Output Fusion
`2 error with heading noise larger than 3◦ . We hypothesize that Output Fusion’s performance is better at this setting due to its low-recall (fewer true positives) relative to V2VNet (0.62 vs. 0.73 at 4◦ noise). Fewer true positives can cause lower`2
error relative to higher recall methods. Degradation from heading noise
is more severe than position noise, as subtle rotation in the ego-view
will cause substantial mis- alignment for far-off objects; a vehicle
bounding box (5m x 2m) rotated by 1◦ with respect to a pivot 70m away
generates an IoU of 0.39 with the original.

Asynchronous Propagation: We simulate random time delay by delaying the
messages of other vehicles at random from U(0, t), where t = 0.1. We
apply a piece-wise linear velocity model (computed via finite
differences) in Output Fusion to compensate for time delay. We do not
make adjustments for LiDAR Fusion as it is non-trivial. As shown in Fig.
9, V2VNet demonstrates robustness across different time delays. Output
Fusion does not perform well at high time delays as the piece-wise
linear model used is sensitive to velocity estimates. 14 T.H. Wang et

Fig. 10: V2V-Net Qualitative Examples. Left: Occluded car detected;
Middle: Perception range increased; Right: Fast car detected.

Mixed Fleet: We also investigate the case that the SDV may receive
differ- ent types of perception messages (i.e., sensor data,
intermediate representation and P&P outputs). We analyze the setting
where every SDV (other than the receiving vehicle) has 1/3 chance to
broadcast each measurement type. We then perform Sensor Fusion, V2VNet,
Output Fusion for the relevant set of messages to generate the final
output. The result is in between the three V2V approaches: 88.6 AP at
IoU=0.7 for detection, 0.79 m error at 3.0s prediction, and 2.63 TCR.

Qualitative Results: As shown in Fig. 10, V2VNet can see further and
handle occlusion. For example, in Fig. 10 far right, we perceive and
motion forecast a high-speed vehicle in our right lane, which can give
the downstream planning system more information to better plan a safe
maneuver for a lane change. V2V-Net also detects many more vehicles in
the scene that were originally not detected by No Fusion (Fig. 10,
middle).

6 Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed a V2V approach for
perception and predic- tion that transmits compressed intermediate
representations of the P&P neural network, achieving the best compromise
between accuracy improvements and bandwidth requirements. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach we have created a novel V2V-Sim
dataset that realistically simulates the world when SDVs will be
ubiquitous. We hope that our findings will inspire future work in V2V
perception and motion forecasting strategies for safer self-driving
cars.
